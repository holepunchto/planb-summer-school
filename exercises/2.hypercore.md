# 0. Setup

Prepare to create a program.

* Make a folder, give it a name
* Run `npm init -y`
* This adds a `package.json` file to your folder and means we can install dependencies into it

# 1. Installing, initializing and using Hypercore

We're going to make a P2P application that uses Hypercore. 

On the command-line, make sure that the current working directory is the newly created folder (`cd path/to/my/folder`), and run the following command:

```
npm install hypercore
```

Make a program that 

* Appends a new block with the string 'hello'
* Prints the public key of the core in hex format
* Prints the length of the core (how many blocks)

# 2. Altering the program to print out content

We want to be able to both read and write from the application. 

Alter the program so that it:

* Appends a new block with the string 'hello' (as before)
* Prints the public key of the core in hex format (as before)
* Prints the content of the block that was written (the alteration)

# 3. Making the program interactive.

We want to be able to interact with our program, writing to the core straight from the keyboard
and reading from the code straight from the screen in real-time.

* Use `process.stdin.on('data', (msg) => { .. })` to append messages from stdin.
* Use the Hypercore API and `process.stdout.write(msg)` print new messages as they are added.
  * Messages are delimited by newlines `\n`
    * i.e. when return is pressed on the keyboard the message should be written to the core

# 4. Using multiple cores

We want our application to support not just one Hypercore, but many, making it possible for all peers in the class to interact with each other. 

Expand upon the program so that it uses `Corestore` to manage multiple Hypercores.

* Add `Corestore` to the program dependencies: `npm install corestore`
* Update the code so that the Hypercore is stored in a Corestore, under the namespace: `local-chat`
* Check that everything still works

# 5. Replicating!

We want our program to be able to connect and share data with other programs.

* Alter the program to a series of Hypercore keys on the command line where it prints all messages added to those Hypercores
  * To get the key arguments from the command line use `process.argv.slice(2)`
* Use the Hyperswarm connection event `store.replicate(connection)` to setup replication.
  * For the swarm `topic` use `Buffer.alloc(32).fill('planb')`.
* Test that replication is working:
  * Copy the folder containing the program to another new folder
    * Now there are two programs on the machine each with their own corestore
  * Share the keys of the Hypercores between the programs to print messages

Now we should be able to interactively chat with ourselves on our own machines :)

# 6. Sharing with the class

We have a program to be able to connect and share data with other programs on other machines,
anywhere in the world.

* Run the program and share the key
* Try hotspotting the connection via phone 
* Discussion, pros/cons. 

# 7. Going from here

* Use the block encryption api to allow support for at rest encrypted data.
  * With this we can blind mirror the chats without a mirror knowing.
* Only make the replication replicate the latest messages to we need to transfer less data.
* Add metadata to your chat. Use JSON or whatever you prefer to encode the blocks
   * Consider adding local timestamps, etc.
