# intro

## 1. motivation

why do we need p2p

### 1.1 centralised approach

This section outlines the centralised approach and discusses some disadvantages.

#### overview

The current server/client approach outsources all state management to a centralised server.

The client can make requests to servers in order to either fetch or mutate the state.

Data is stored server side and _served_ to the client on demand.

#### shortcomings

1. Data Privacy / Sovereignty

By design, the server owns all data and observes all transactions

How can we enforce our privacy to be respected?

2. Security / Reliability

The server controls state for all clients. Therefore, it is a single point of failure and an obvious target for attackers:

Compromise the server and you compromise the entire system.

Even in non-malicious settings, this is a risk. eg:

Forget to pay AWS bill and a whole site can be lost.

Whatsapp outages, technical error and billions left stranded without communication

#### why is it this way?

### 1.2 decentralised approach

how would we do it in a decentralised setting

#### how does it overcome the disadvantages

why is decentralisation better in this context

#### whats possible

what we can do with p2p that we couldn't otherwise

#### (whats not possible?)

(maybe present overview of challenges)

## 2. p2p technology

technical overview of p2p

### 2.1 breakdown of the stack

what do we need to be decentralised

## 3. examples

where can we see this in practice

### 3.1 bitcoin

how does bitcoin go about p2p

### 3.1 hypercore

how does hypercore go about p2p
